'''
when user defines x=15, python saves the value 15 in memory and name the memory space as 'x'.
In python we need not say String x ="hi". based on the value assigned to the variable pythod does is by itself.
We can change the value of a variable from int to string or viceversa or to any other format like float, string etc.
'''
x = 15
print(x)
x=20
print(x)
x="I am a String Now"
print(x)
